# Conversation Memory Implementation

## Overview

The chatbot now supports conversation memory, allowing it to maintain context across multiple questions in a single chat session. This enables natural follow-up questions and references to previous parts of the conversation.

## Features

### 1. Context-Aware Responses

- The bot remembers previous Q&A pairs in the conversation
- Can handle follow-up questions like "tell me more about that" or "what about sick days?"
- Understands pronouns and references to earlier topics

### 2. Visual Indicators

- Auto-scrolls to show the latest response
- Maintains conversation history in the sidebar

### 3. Enhanced Prompting

- Includes previous conversation in the LLM prompt
- Provides context about what was discussed earlier
- Improves understanding of ambiguous questions

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "How many vacation days do I get?"
Bot: "Full-time employees get 15 days paid vacation, increasing to 20 days after 3 years."

User: "What about sick days?"
Bot:
"In addition to the vacation days we just discussed, you also get 10 sick days per year."

User: "Tell me more about that policy"
Bot:
"Regarding the sick leave policy mentioned earlier, here are the details..."
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced API Endpoint**: `/api/chat` now accepts `conversationHistory` array
2. **New Method**: `generateConversationResponse()` in OllamaClient
3. **Context-Aware Prompting**: Includes previous Q&A pairs in the LLM prompt
4. **Fallback Mode**: Even demo mode is conversation-aware

### Frontend Changes

1. **History Transmission**: Sends conversation history with each request
2. **Context Detection**: Shows visual indicator when context is used
3. **Auto-Scroll**: Automatically scrolls to show new responses

### Data Flow

```
Frontend Chat → Previous Messages → Backend API → LLM with Context → Response with Context Flag → Frontend Display
```

## Testing the Feature

1. Start a new chat
2. Ask: "How many vacation days do I get?"
3. Follow up with: "What about sick days?"
4. Try: "Tell me more about that"

## Benefits

- **Natural Conversations**: Users can ask follow-up questions naturally
- **Better Understanding**: Bot understands references and pronouns
- **Improved UX**: No need to repeat context in each question
- **Smart Retrieval**: Can combine current query with conversation context for better document retrieval

## Configuration

The conversation memory is automatically enabled and requires no additional configuration. It works with both Ollama-powered responses and fallback demo mode.
