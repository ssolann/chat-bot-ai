## Understanding Stock Market Basics

The stock market is a collection of markets where shares of publicly held companies are issued, bought, and sold. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece of ownership in a company.

Key concepts every investor should understand:
- Market capitalization: The total value of a company's shares
- Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio: A valuation metric comparing stock price to earnings per share
- Dividend yield: Annual dividends per share divided by stock price
- Volume: The number of shares traded during a specific period

## Investment Strategies

### Value Investing
Value investing involves buying stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic value. Investors look for companies with:
- Low P/E ratios compared to industry averages
- Strong balance sheets with low debt
- Consistent dividend payments
- Experienced management teams

### Growth Investing
Growth investors focus on companies expected to grow earnings faster than the market average. These stocks typically:
- Have high P/E ratios reflecting growth expectations
- Reinvest profits rather than paying dividends
- Operate in expanding markets or industries
- Show consistent revenue and earnings growth

### Technical Analysis
Technical analysis involves studying price charts and trading patterns to predict future price movements. Key indicators include:
- Moving averages (50-day, 200-day)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Support and resistance levels
- Trading volume patterns

## Risk Management

Successful investing requires understanding and managing risk:

### Diversification
Don't put all your money in one stock or sector. Spread investments across:
- Different industries (technology, healthcare, finance)
- Company sizes (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap)
- Geographic regions (domestic and international)
- Asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities)

### Position Sizing
Never invest more than you can afford to lose in a single stock. Common rules:
- No single position should exceed 5-10% of your portfolio
- Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline
- Use stop-loss orders to limit downside risk

### Market Timing
Timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible. Instead:
- Use dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk
- Focus on long-term investment horizons
- Don't try to catch falling knives or chase hot stocks
- Stay disciplined during market volatility

## Stock Analysis Fundamentals

### Financial Statement Analysis
Key metrics to evaluate when analyzing stocks:

**Income Statement:**
- Revenue growth trends
- Profit margins (gross, operating, net)
- Earnings per share (EPS) growth
- Return on equity (ROE)

**Balance Sheet:**
- Debt-to-equity ratio
- Current ratio (current assets/current liabilities)
- Book value per share
- Cash and cash equivalents

**Cash Flow Statement:**
- Operating cash flow
- Free cash flow
- Cash flow growth trends
- Capital expenditure patterns

### Valuation Methods
Common approaches to determine if a stock is fairly valued:

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Compare to industry average and historical values
2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Useful for asset-heavy companies
3. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**: Calculate present value of future cash flows
4. **Comparable Company Analysis**: Compare valuations to similar companies`,
